The first installment in the Dungeon Intern series, this game was made collaborating with the wonderful guys at [Wauhaus Productions](https://wauhaus.itch.io/) and it represented our submission for the [GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023).
It was also my first time working in team and my first real experience with the Godot engine.

The theme of the jam was *Roles Reversed*, so we came up with the idea for a dungeon crawler where instead of controlling the typical hero bashing through rooms and killing monsters, you instead took the role of the humble *goblin intern* tasked with resetting the traps and rooms of the dungeon so that the next hero wouldn't notice it had already been cleared!
The game thus has the player run through a dungeon frantically trying to *keep up the facade*: game over is reached as soon as one of the heroes ravaging through the dungeon becomes too suspicious, which can happen when they face exhausted traps or spot the protagonist setting things up.

As you can recall, this experience consisted of a lot of firsts: the first time working in team, the first time participating in a large game jam and the first time using the Godot game engine.
As you can imagine the combination of novelty factors made development significantly harder, and a series of problem with versioning meant some pieces of code had to be rewritten many, many, many times: this troubled development didn't allow us to bring our full vision for the game to life, forcing us to publish it in a quite under-polished state, even for a game jam entry. \
Nonetheless, the experience was incredibly fun!
Working in team, bouncing ideas off of each other, meeting up for the jam and spending that weekend together working on something creative was an amazing experience, and one for which I'm very glad.

Anyway, if the idea of the game intrigues you and you wish to try a shell of what could have been, feel free to do so following the link below!
