My first ever game project, made in 72 hours for the [Wowie Game Jam 4.0](https://itch.io/jam/wowie-jam-4).
The theme of the jam was *"Collaborate with AI"*, so I came up with the idea for a simulation game where the objective is to **maintain the population of two species** (whose behaviour is driven by Ai) for as long as possible.

<!--more-->

More specifically, two kind of creatures are present in the game: *Popis*, who are vegetarian and eat green leaves that randomly spawn in the game space, and *Gonzos*, who are carnivorous and eat Popis.
Both need to eat or they'll starve to death, and by eating they can reproduce.
The game thus has the player balance the population of these two species by constructing walls to divide them, while at the same time making sure none of the two goes completely extinct.

Being my first real project developed in such a short amount of time the game is extremely under-polished.
I was learning to use Unity on the go and had to implement A* pathfinding in an engine I didn't completely know: nowadays I would have just used the navigation system, but back then I didn't even know it existed!
Maybe someday I will return to this idea to make a post-jam version, as I still find it quite interesting.
In the meantime, you can try the game on itch.io by following the links below!
