Made in 72 hours with the wonderful guys at [Wauhaus Productions](https://wauhaus.itch.io/), this game was our submission for the [Mini Jam 152: Heroes](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-152-heroes), for which it gained us **9th place**!
I'm extremely proud of this result and the work we've done in such a small period of time, but let's stop boasting and start discussing the game itself.

Mini Jams are a format of game jam that comes with both a theme and a limitation, where the former is optional and tends to be more general while the latter is a mandatory restriction: this time the theme was *"Heroes"* and the limitation was *"Only two items"*.
Being the hotheads we are we decided to interpret the "items" in the limitation as in "items on a menu", giving our game a culinary twist: from there we envisioned a small arcade title where the goal of the player is to *satisfy the most number of people while serving only two items on the menu*.
The game would require fast reflexes and the ability to abstract information on the preference of each of the heroes (*\*wink\**) that would visit the tavern in order to prepare the dishes that would make most of them happy.

Such abysmal working conditions required a relatable protagonist to serve as the butt of the joke, so we happily decided to make this title the second installment of our **Dungeon Intern** series, condemning our poor goblin intern to be forever enslaved by its corporate overlords.
If you too wish to see our stressed little green guy frantically run around in an attempt to fix the unfixable, head over to itch.io with the link below and try the game!
